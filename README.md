I created the POSCON UK Controller pack to re-create basically the Euroscope profiles (to everyone who comes here from VATSIM). 

For now done:

1. EGLL Heathrow

2. EGKK Gatwick

3. Essex (EGGS Stansted, EGGW Luton and Cambridge)

4. EGCC Manchester


How to load it:

1. Open the Radar client in the POSCON Launcher
2. Type “LOADSCT” in the square box you should have on the left of the Radar screen
3. Load the desired sector file 
4. Zoom in to the airport and enjoy!

I know that at the moment the airports are not a lot, but I have to handpick everything regarding an airport from the sector file and I take up to an hour to create just an airport, and, unfortunately, this isn’t my real life job and I don’t have a lot of free time :) If you want to speed up the creation, please consider helping me! Thank you!

Should you have any question, report or just want to help me, feel free to drop me a DM on Discord (Username: Filippo#8739)
